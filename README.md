Example app written for article purpose:
[How to write video chat app using webrtc and nodejs](https://tsh.io/blog/how-to-write-video-chat-app-using-webrtc-and-nodejs/)

## Startup

```npm install```

```npm run dev```

## Heroku App

## Errors

Heroku isn't binding to port 3000 and it's timing out. Maybe a type script problem. Because my other node apps don't have this problem.
